# Exploratory Data Analysis on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Dataset
About the Project
In this project, I've worked with the PCOS dataset that contains physical and clinical parameters of patients. PCOS, as you might know, is a complex disorder affecting menstrual cycles, hormone levels, and fertility. My aim was to unravel valuable insights from this dataset to contribute to our understanding of PCOS diagnosis and related issues.
Data Source
The dataset I used was collected from various hospitals across Kerala, India. You can access and support this dataset on Kaggle.
What I Explored
Data Quality Check:

I started by checking for any inconsistencies or errors in the data. After all, clean data is crucial for accurate analysis.
Diagnosis Distribution Visualization:

I created visualizations to understand how PCOS diagnoses are distributed within the dataset. Visualizing the data often helps in spotting trends.
Feature Relationships:

To understand the relationship between different diagnostic features and the likelihood of PCOS, I dived into various visualizations. This gave me insights into which factors are strongly associated with PCOS.
Patterns in Features:

By visualizing the distribution of different features separately for PCOS-positive and negative cases, I could identify patterns that might aid in diagnosis.
