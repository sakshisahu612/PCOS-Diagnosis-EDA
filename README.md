# Exploratory Data Analysis on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Dataset

## Project Overview
*This project delves into the intricacies of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a multifaceted medical condition impacting women's health. PCOS affects menstrual cycles, hormone levels, and fertility, presenting diagnostic challenges. The objective here is to analyze a comprehensive dataset to gain insights into PCOS diagnosis and its associated factors.*

## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from various healthcare institutions across Kerala, India. Access to and contribution toward enriching this dataset is available on Kaggle.

## Exploration Highlights
### Data Quality Check:
A critical initial step involved meticulous examination of data integrity. Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the dataset is essential for subsequent analyses.

### Diagnosis Distribution Visualization:
Visual representations were employed to elucidate the distribution of PCOS diagnoses within the dataset. Visualizing the data aids in identifying trends and patterns.

### Understanding Feature Relationships:
Exploring the relationship between diagnostic features and the likelihood of PCOS involved in-depth analysis. Visualizations were instrumental in uncovering correlations and significant factors associated with PCOS.

### Identifying Feature Patterns:
Comparing feature distributions between PCOS-positive and negative cases facilitated the identification of distinct patterns. These patterns offer valuable insights potentially aiding in more accurate diagnosis and management of PCOS.

*This project aims to enhance understanding of PCOS and contribute to advancements in its diagnosis and treatment through comprehensive data exploration.*
